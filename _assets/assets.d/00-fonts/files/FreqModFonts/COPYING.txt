For derived works please use the FreqMod Artistic or FreqMod clear fonts, and then merge with fonts afterwards for simpler licensing,
then you only have to care about the SIL OFL (which i prefer).

If some of the authors of the works which i have derived think i have misunderstood their licenses and licensed their fonts in a wrong way, please
contact me and I will stop using the work, and try to find a solution.
